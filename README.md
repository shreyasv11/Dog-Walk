# Dog-Walk

Welcome to the Dog Walk Snap Project! This is a simple interactive game created using Snap, where you can take your dog on a walk. The scene changes whenever the dog touches either the left or right corner of the screen.

The project can be found at this link: https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=vshreyas&ProjectName=dogwalk

A demo is here:
